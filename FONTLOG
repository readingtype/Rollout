Reading Type Rollout 1.0

1.  FONTLOG for Rollout
This file provides detailed information on the Rollout font software.
This information should be distributed along with the Rollout fonts and any derivative works.

2.  Basic Font Information
Rollout was drawn in 1998 on a Macintosh IIx running Macromedia Fontographer 4 and System 7.1. It was released without a license in 2001. From the current release, re-encoded in OpenType format and with FontForge files included in the distribution, Rollout is still available freely but its use, distribution and reproduction is now governed by the terms of the SIL Open Font License. A copy is included with this distribution: see the License file.

The current release was generated in April 2008 with a MacBook Pro running FontForge and MacOS X 10.4.
